### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my blog although it is still under construction.

I am currently a student at SDU, China. Passionate about Internet, Software, Computing, etc.

From Jiangsu prov. Coding is just my hobby, but not my major, which is a pity. Anyway, feel free to contact me if you are faced with similar problems.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, JavaScript, Dotnet, C/C++, OS, Internet & Web dev, etc.
