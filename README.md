### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my blog on GitHub Pages although it is still under construction.

I am currently a student at SDU, China. Passionate about Internet, Software, Computing, etc.

From NJ, Jiangsu prov, China. Coding is just my hobby, but not my major, which may be a pity. Feel free to contact with me as I enjoy making friends.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, JavaScript, Dotnet, C/C++, OS, Internet & Web dev, etc.
